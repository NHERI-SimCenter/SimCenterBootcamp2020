    "1. use one file per class, \n",
    "2. name that file the name of the class.py \n",
    "3. Use all lowercase for the filename since some operation systems are case sensitive and your code may break if you mix upper and lowercase the wrong way.\n",
    "4. import classes where needed and ONLY where needed\n",
    "5. start each file with a multi-line comment block explaining \n",
    "   1. name of the file (so you can find the file on your computer if you find a printout)\n",
