    "Let us start this chapter with the question: **\"What is object oriented programming (OOP)?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The west way to approach this question is to review the common programming style most of you may have used in MATLAB, or even in python up to this point:\n",
    "1. variables contain data\n",
    "2. functions manipulate data\n",
    "3. the user needs to maintain control of data, usually in the main execution branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy leads to problems as the program grows increasingly complex.  \n",
    "In a business type analogy: the customer tries to keep total control over a merchand, manufacturer, transportation agencies, contractors, ..., i.e., this is micro-managing your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same business-like analogy illustrates the **object oriented approach**:\n",
    "1. Your project requires a series of companies, agencies, subcontractors, etc., to work together. \n",
    "2. However, each company provides a set of specialized skills (none does everything), has their own employees, their proprietary know-how (tghat will not be shared with the competition!), or agencies have protected data (think privacy protection) or secrets (think about the military).\n",
    "3. Each company has a well defined communication channel: project manager, foreman, county clerk, teller, etc.  All communications must go through those agents.  All data exchange is handled and controlled by those agents.\n",
    "4. Each company has an undisclosed number of specialists, who can perform some tasks, if requested by a communication agent.  No direct interaction is possible between those employees of one company with undisclosed employees of another.  See \"well defined communication channels\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an approach is considered object-oriented.  Each company/agency is one object.  Each object holds information (data) and skills (methods = the OOP term for functions).  The idea is to compartmentalize portions of the code, make them independent of each other, make them exchangeable (different libraries with identical communication structure).  This allows for team work when building complex code, as well as easier and more reliable testing of those building blocks."

    "Python is an object oriented language just as C++.  As such, many similarities exist between the two languages.  However, python is much more relaxed than C++ when it comes to data protection (no protected variables).  Moreover, it does not provide an easy mechanism to overload methods of identical name but different argument type.  I will show later how to emulate that behavior in python."

    "One of the most powerful concepts of OOP is inheritance.  Let's explain this by looking at your own code: you may have developed code to represent a Dog.  You may also implement code to represent a Cat.  Since both are Pets, you may just copy Dog to Cat and edit where they differ.  However, what if you find a bug in Dog?  You need to fix that bug in Dog and in its copy, Cat.  Adding a new method will result in similar duplication.  Now think of a big family with Cat, Dog, Hamster, Guineapig, and a Goldfish.  You'll have to edit 5 copies, duplicating lots of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP solution to eliminate duplication is inheritance: Create a class (Pet) that defines what all those animals have in common (here it's a name, the __str__() and the __repr__() methods).  Define Dog, Cat, etc., are children classes of Pet (Parent class).  That way, the children inherit all the functionalities and methods of the parent.  You only define whats new and/or different."
