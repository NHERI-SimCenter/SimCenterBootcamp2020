Welcome to the NHERI-SimCenter 2020 Programming Bootcamp
=====================================================

For the past few years, this bootcamp was offered as a week-long intensive workshop
at the University of California Richmond Field Station.
Due to covid-19, this year's offering will be solely online. 
The format will be two weeks of three (3) hours of online lectures and exercises via zoom, followed by
daily self-study homework assignments.  Every morning, office hours are held for one (1) hour before
the actual meetings.

.. note::

   Course material is available through 
   the `NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenterBootcamp2020 <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenterBootcamp2020>`_
   repository on https://github.com 

   You will need your own GitHub account to participate in our exercises.
