Assignments for Day 3
===============

.. note::

	Day 3 will introduce you to :green:`object oriented programming (OOP)`. 
	This is the key strategy used in team development of more complex code, or simply helping you
	write more stable and better readable code.  Moreover, OOP is the key concept behind languages
	like :fuchsia:`Java` or :fuchsia:`C++` (You will utilize the same concepts in Part 2 of this bootcamp).

	You will also learn how to use OOP to :green:`implement your own data types`, something that allows you to
	expand python and make it more usable for your research.
