Assignments
=======

You will get daily assignments to develop and deepen your programming skills.  
Each assignment typically includes one or more of the following.

* Lecture video selection for self-study.
* Exercise supporting the self-study section.
* Development and discussion of the involved algorithm(s).
* A software design and flow section.
* Design of a suitable testing/validation procedure.
* The actual software implementation.

.. warning::

	Video and linked exercises are due before the online class sections.

	We will spend our live sessions mostly doing hands-on exercises.  Those
	exercises are only effective if you did your self-study assignment before
	we meet.
