Install Python
==============

Install Python on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have not yet installed Python 3.7, we recommend installing Python 3.7 from 
`Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows>`_. We recommend installing using the 
**Windowsx86 64-bit executable installer**.  

.. note::

   Allow the installer to change your system environment variables so that the directory containing the executable is on your path. This requires checking the small box asking for this when the installer starts. The box is located at bottom of installer application window.

.. warning::
   The latest version of Python is 3.8.3 At time of writing Python 3.8.3 was no working with the current **numpy** package.

Once Python is installed, you need to extend it by installing the following packages: **numpy**, **scipy**, **tables**, **hdf5** and **pandas**. To install these packages, start a `terminal window as an Admin user <https://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-8.1/>`_ and in that window type the following instructions:

.. code-block:: python


   pip3 install numpy
   pip3 install scipy
   pip3 install matplotlib
   pip3 install pandas openpyxl xlrd xlwt xlsxwriter
   pip3 install selenium 
pip3 install bs4 
pip3 install lxml 
pip3 install requests 
pip3 install geopandas 
pip3 install census 
pip3 install us



Install Python on a Mac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mac comes with Python pre-installed, which is currently the outdated version 2.7. As of January 1st, 2020 no new bug reports, fixes, or changes will be made to Python 2, and Python 2 is officially no longer supported. SimCenter tools require Python 3. We recommend installing Python 3.7 from `Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx>`_ using the 
**macOS 64-bit installer**. The installer will place a python3 executable in your /usr/local/bin directory, whose location should be on your system PATH. Version 3.8 does not appear to do so anymore, see the note below. 

.. note:: 
   #. We use the python.org installation over others, due to it's simplicity of install.
   #. In the current installation of **Python** it leaves two script files in a folder when the installation ends. You need to execute both script files to get Python set up correctly so that it can be invoked from the terminal. To execute the files, double click on them. The two files, shown in the image below, are: **Update Shell Profile.command.sh** and **Install CertificateCommand.sh**.

      Python: Folder Displayed at Conclusion of Install

Once Python is installed, you need to extend it by installing the following packages: **numpy**, **scipy**, and **pandas**. To install these packages, start a terminal window and type the following instructions:

.. code-block:: python

      pip3 install numpy
      pip3 install scipy
      pip3 install pandas
      pip3 install tables
      pip3 install hdf5

.. note:: 
   #. To start a terminal window you can use the spotlight app (magnifying glass at the top right corner of the desktop). Start the spotlight app and type in terminal. The terminal application should appear as the top hit. Click on it to start it.

   #. When the |app| is running, open the File/Preferences and make sure that python3 appears under **External Applications:Python**. If you used older versions of SimCenter tools this was not the default.

   #. As an alternative, you can install the SimCenter's pelicun module, which will include all three of the above

   .. code-block:: python

      pip3 install pelicun

.. note::

   If you forget to invoke the **UpdateShellProfile.command.sh" script at the end of the install, you can always edit the correct shell file later to update the **PATH** variable to point to the python application.

   On Linux systems, the shell is the program that takes commands from the keyboard that you enter in the terminal window and passes them to the operating system to perform by invoking applications and passing data between applications. In the good old days, it was the only interface available to the user, i.e. there was no such thing as Finder! There are a number of shell programs that can be installed and made available to you. The most popular is the **bash** shell, the up and coming one is the **Z** shell. Power MacOS users will write shell scripts to do many many useful things. By default the applications that the shell program will invoke are limited to applications in a few specific directories that are defined in the users **PATH**. Users can modify this path by editing files that the shell program will read from everytime the program is started.

  When the frontend application is running the computations it is actually running a backend application using the shell program. As a consequence the shell program must be made aware of the locations of  some of the external applications that you have installed as **OpenSees** and **dakota** do not provide installers that automatically do this when they are installed. Other applications, like **Tcl** provide scripts that you invoke to do it. In short you have to edit the file appropriate to the shell you are using.

  To find which shell prgram you are using when you issue commands inside the terminal window, type the following in a terminal window:

  .. code:: none
   
	env | grep SHELL

  If the results is **/bin/bash** you will need to edit the **.bashrc** file or the **bash_profile** file. If the results is **/bin/zsh** you will need to edit the **.zshrc** or **.zprofile**. Typically the **.bash_profile** or the **.zprofile** file is the one to edit as these typically by design will invoke the **.bashrc** or **.zshrc** file. If in doubt, look for these files in your hime directory and see which of these other installlers have modified.
