Assignments for Day 2
===============

.. note::

	Day 2 will focus on :green:`numeric data types` for linear algebra (vectors and matrices), introduce
	:green:`plotting` features available in python, and show you how to :green:`read and write data from
	files` on your computer.

	:red:`If you are already experienced using` :green:`numpy`, :green:`matplotlib` and doing :green:`file I/O`,
	we still ask you to actively participate and help others learn quicker by facilitating small
	group discussions in which you can share your insight.
